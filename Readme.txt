Business Problem - 

1. You are an expat planning to move to Melbourne and need to which region might be a good market to look for housing? Also you want to understand which factors influence pricing the most so you can 

Hypothesis H1 - The price of houses is correlated with Distance from CBD and landsize.

2. Since you are investing your life savings - you would like to engage a bright data scientist to build a predictive model that can explain which variables are most likely (distance from downtown, size of dwelling unit, affordability etc.) to influence your choice given a budget constraint (real world scenario) 

Solution Engineering - 

DataSet - 
I have used a dataset of Melbourne property sales pertaining to 2016-2018 to identify if there a difference in pricing between the top 3 regions(geographic sub-markets) - 

Additionally I have combined Australian Benchmark 10-year bond yields from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IRLTLT01AUM156N to help explain pricing.
